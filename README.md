BeautifulScraper
----------------

Simple wraper around BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and urllib2 for HTTP(S) request/response handling.  BeautifulScraper also overrides some of the default handlers in urllib2 in order to:
  * Handle cookies properly
  * Offer full control of included cookies
  * Return the actual response from the server, un-mangled and not reprocessed

Examples
--------
```python
todo
```
